Before compiling any files int the ZZ framework, you need to do the following:

  - Set your path to include 'ZZ/BUILD' or, alternatively, make an alias 'zb'
    to point to 'ZZ/BUILD/zb'.

  - In 'ZZ/EXTERN' do 'hg clone https://bitbucket.org/alanmi/abc' to
    install the latest version of ABC.

  - Make sure you have Python 2.6 or later installed.

  - Make sure you have developer header files installed for 'libz'.

Now you can compile any binary by going into the appropriate directory, e.g.
'ZZ/Bip', and typing 'zb'. Most binaries are put into 'zz/bin/<machine>', but
some "debug" binaries are put into the local directory. This is determined by
the contents of 'MODULE.conf' in each directory (where a '@' in front of the
name in the 'PUBLISH_BIN' line indicates a local installation).
